                The First Tech Challenge (FTC) is a yearly challenge that encourages students to build and
                program robots to compete in that years First Tech Challenge.

                <hr>
                We have been competing in FTC since 2017, and use,learn, and gain skills to design and build robots. 
                During the competitive season we focus on the robot, but during the entire year we focus on gaining skills
                and spreading STREM. 
                <hr>
                <br>
                We also spend time helping several First Lego League (FLL) teams, and love to help these teams do well 
                in their Project and Robot Competition
