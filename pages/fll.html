                When students are engaged in hands-on STEM experiences, they build confidence, grow
                their knowledge and develop habits of learning. When adults coach these students, they encourage them to
                try, fail, and try again, while connecting STEM concepts to real-world examples.

                FIRST速 LEGO速 League is the most accessible, guided, global robotics competition, helping students and
                teachers to build a better future together. The program is built around theme-based Challenges to engage
                children ages 9 to 16* in research, problem solving, coding, and engineering. The foundation of the
                program is the FIRST速 Core Values, which emphasize teamwork, discovery, and innovation. Students emerge
                more confident, excited, and equipped with the skills they need in a changing workforce.
