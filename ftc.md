Itâ€™s way more than building robots. FIRST Tech Challenge teams (up to 15 team members, grades 7-12) are challenged to design, build, program, and operate robots to compete in a head-to-head challenge in an alliance format. Guided by adult coaches and mentors, students develop STEM skills and practice engineering principles, while realizing the value of hard work, innovation, and working as a team. The robot kit is reusable from year to year and can be coded using a variety of levels of Java-based programming. Teams design and build robots, raise funds, design and market their team brand, and do community outreach to earn specific awards. Participants are eligible to apply for $80M+ in college scholarships. Each season concludes with regional championship events and an exciting FIRST Championship.

<!-- Dear future people, if you read this and the season years are wrong, update them please! -->
First Tech Challenge (FTC for short) is a robotics competition. In the current season (2020-2021), The (extremely) simplified objective is to move rings and wobble goals around the field to gain points. You can find more about it [here](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc/), or view our resources [here](/resources.html).
