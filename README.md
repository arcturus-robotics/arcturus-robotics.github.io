Our (mostly) handmade website.

## Build

### Console

Run the script that matches your operating system.
That'll be `scripts/build.sh` on macOS/Linux/*nix
and `scripts/build.bat` on Windows.
It should tell you what to put in your browser.

### CodeKit

All needed configurations for CodeKit are in the `config.codekit3` file.

Click the little eye + window icon to open up the website in your default browser.
