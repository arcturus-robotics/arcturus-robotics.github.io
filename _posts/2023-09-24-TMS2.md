The new driver hub is almost completely inoperable so we've switched to using a backup phone for the driver station. Progress (not much, but some) was made on the drone launcher. Progress (not much, but some) was made on the expander intake mechanism, which still needs to be mounted to a slide. Odometry code was added to center-stage-app in preparation for the new goBilda odometry kit arriving. We worked on building a new smaller slide to fit on the robot. Also we followed up on a lot of sponsorship opportunities.
