Today we finished making the custom chassis driveable, by making a new configuration for it as well as a new program (CSTeleOp). We also tried implementing gyro drive, however this is not currently working. Our lone driver hub has been deemed fully trashed and we will most likely go back to using phones this season. We also did more outreach and made two new instagram posts.
