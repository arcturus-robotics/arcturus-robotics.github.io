## This blog post is just a test to see if this thing still works
uh I guess i'll show you how to write some cool code

'''java
import fun
public static void main(String[] args) {
  boolean arcturus = fun.testForFun("#13245 ARCTURUS");
  if (arcturus) {
    print("Arcturus is fun!");
  }
  else {
    print("This would never get printed, because arcturus is indeed fun");
  }
}
