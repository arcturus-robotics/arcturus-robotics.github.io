Comments on league meets lets go (in no order in particular, writing today so i dont forget haha)
- Intake definitely needs major improvement (but we knew that)
- Backup main driver is CRUCIAL for states as Pranav won't be able to continue like this while being able to drive at the same level
- Fix back autonomi
- POSSIBLY take from stack
- From what I saw from the judge's notes on our portfolio, they thought our script was a little unorganized with not good enough time management (they had to cut us off) so let's make sure to do a lot more practice on script before state
- The portfolio, while great in every area currently, probably isn't super detailed enough in certain areas that the awards are looking for. I'll be working on portfolio for state (sorry about not helping that much for this tournament) and i'll work on making sure we cover every area required for certain awards.
- April Tags extremely important for taking from stack, PLUS if added would be great for control award
- Camera positioning will need to be tuned properly for revised intake. Also of note is that in our final match (the one I played) against Robotic Eagles, our camera actually WAS detecting their red shirts. This could have been a major issue had I not been able to force the camera down. So, when deciding new camera placement, take height into account.
- Wire management (i think a complete rewiring from the ground up is neccesary)
- And last but not least make the robot look awesome
