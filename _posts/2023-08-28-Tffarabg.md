- For torque intensive tasks (slides), no more than a 312 rpm motor
- Always change the whole motor and never just the gearbox
- If a motor works, DONT CHANGE IT
- If a wheel works, DONT CHANGE IT
- If an intake works and it works well, DONT CHANGE IT
- Never create something you cant dissasemble and reassemble again. 
- Dont be hesitant to 3D print something you already designed (phone case, battery case, etc)
- Stop yawning and burping while you have an ear infection (it's really painful)
- If you want to test if something is broken, TEST IT OFF OF THE ROBOT, AND DONT DO IT AT THE COMPETITION
- Dont be affraid to max out the tension on the odometry capsules 
- Stop writing useless information in a .txt file, you have homework to do
- Never let guys who cant tell the difference between the 3 different types of set screws work on the robot. 
- If a thing you are looking for existed at some point, then it probably still exists, it is just burried under all of the useless gobilda parts arsh ordered last year.
- Rev Chassi parts suck and dont let anybody else tell you otherwise
- If a fellow arcuturs member asks you to not mess with them or with something they are working on, then do them a solid and ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THEM. 
- PID should always work, you should never have to create a makeshift, crappy replacement to it. 
- If you dont know how to differentiate between the different types of screws, then dont try to organize them
- Dont push your luck with the coaches, they will take action if you act too chaotic 
- Also dont pusch your luck with memes, anythign inapropriate will ignite action 
- Reddit is (never) the answer to all your ftc problems
