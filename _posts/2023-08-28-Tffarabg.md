- For torque intensive tasks (slides), no more than a 312 rpm motor
- Always change the whole motor and never just the gearbox
- If a motor works, DONT CHANGE IT
- If a wheel works, DONT CHANGE IT
- If an intake works and it works well, DONT CHANGE IT
- Never create something you cant dissasemble and reassemble again. 
- Dont be hesitant to 3D print something you already designed (phone case, battery case, etc)
- Stop yawning and burping while you have an ear infection (it's really painful)
- If you want to test if something is broken, TEST IT OFF OF THE ROBOT, AND DONT DO IT AT THE COMPETITION
- Dont be affraid to max out the tension on the odometry capsules 
- Stop writing useless information in a .txt file, you have homework to do
- Never let guys who cant tell the difference between the 3 different types of set screws work on the robot. 
- If a thing you are looking for existed at some point, then it probably still exists, it is just burried under all of the useless gobilda parts arsh ordered last year.
- Rev Chassi parts suck and dont let anybody else tell you otherwise
- If a fellow arcuturs member asks you to not mess with them or with something they are working on, then do them a solid and ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THEM. 
- PID should always work, you should never have to create a makeshift, crappy replacement to it. 
- If you dont know how to differentiate between the different types of screws, then dont try to organize them
- Dont push your luck with the coaches, they will take action if you act too chaotic 
- Also dont pusch your luck with memes, anythign inapropriate will ignite action 
- Reddit is (never) the answer to all your ftc problems
- If you do any of the following:
	a. Complain that the robot phones are too old or broken
	b. Claim that iphone is better than android or vice versa
	c. start political talk
I will ban you from playing videogames
- The snack economy is a capitalist economy, where the person who brings the snacks decides who gets to eat their snacks and if they can have seconds. 
- Being useless is not allowed, which includes watching videos or playing games outside of break time (Only exceptions are board games which are banned from all meetings anyway)
- The term "hazing" is banned 
- Arnav is not allowed to come to a new member's first meeting.
- Making fun of people because of the TV show or anime that they watched is not allowed (but you can make fun of the TV show or anime itself)
- Everybody says stupid or incorrect stuff all the time, so dont torture them over something stupid or incorrect they said
- The team captain reserves the right to stop any music being played on open speakers. 
- Swearing is not allowed
- Dont try to reinvent the wheel when solving robot problems.
