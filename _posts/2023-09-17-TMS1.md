We finished assembling the center stage field with half the parts but a full array of tiles. We then took the old robot V2 chassis and swapped the middle connectors with two 6 long goBilda U-Channels. We also altered the mounting of the hubs and got rid of the old slide so that all the chassis can do now is drive. We updated the software on the hub to 9.0 to be competition legal, then tested the robot and it runs amazingly with almost perfect strafing and can fit under every part of the truss. This chassis will be the base for our Centerstage robot this competition season.
