Time management is key to a world-class robot.

After the challenge is released for the first four weeks should focus on research and brainstorming. For the research have the entire team look at the pros and cons of different wheelbases and different mechanisms. The brainstorming should be on the wheelbase, main mechanism (the part that gets the points for that main object), and side mechanism (smaller missions like autonomous parts, phone cases, and battery holder). Put this brainstorming in 3 different lists. The first list should be wheelbases, the second should be the main mechanism, and the third should be the side mechanism.

By the beginning of October, the research and brainstorming should be done. For the first week of October, the selections of what should be on the robot should happen. For the rest of the month, the building team should start CADing. The coding team should start coding the wheelbase. When the CADing is done the parts should be ordered. While the parts are being shipped the team can practice and do tryouts for driving.

When the parts arrive the building team should start with the wheelbase. Then go onto the main mechanism. Finally, go onto the side mechanisms. When the wheelbase is done the coding team should start altering the code so it works with the base. After this, the build team should add other mechanisms to the base. Now the code team should make sure the robot works.

This should be done by the first or second week of December. Know the coding team should start coding autonomous. The building team should assist by doing maintenance of the robot and resetting the field. This should be done through winter break.

The rest of the time should be driver practice and slight alterations to the code. 

Throughout the season the entire team should go to every possible scrimmage. If everything was done right your robot will be a world-class robot in First Tech Challenge.
