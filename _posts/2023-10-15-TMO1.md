Drone launcher works, FTC SDK & driver station updated so all tech is good, gearbox arrived robot can hang now. Odometry capsules taken off robot, work also done on V1 chassis. Pincer kind of works I guess? I hope. New autonomous code is in progress for scoring preloaded pixels, also work is being done so pincer can grab two pixels. Signs added (i think) alliance markers added (i think) hopefully our swap markers things will be printed but who knows, driver practice is pretty much nonexistent right now so yknow.
