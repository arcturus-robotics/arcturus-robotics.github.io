## What Does Getting Involved in Robotics Early Mean?

As the world of technology Develops, it has been increasing popular for kids to go into the vast realm of technology. From doing a basic summer camp to joining a robotics team or club. These are all great ways for really getting involved. 

#### What can you do to get involved? :

* **Join a Summer Camp** if you have the slighest bit of interest, it is better to test out the domain of technology than just sit and wonder if technology was ever for you
* **Join a club!** Clubs are always are a great way to define your interest and further test things out. It is perfectly **okay** if technology is not your stride. 
* **Do it for Fun!** There is no point to doing something just for the *resume* or otherwise. You have to engage with robotics in order for it to be truly involved
* Last, but not least **Compete**. Competing is way to meet others doing the same thing you are doing. Delveloping and learning essential life skills surronding robotics. Not only that, putting a face to compeititon and actually meeting them is a whole other motivation to get stronger and better in technology. Comepeting is one of the *the best* ways to further involve yourself with robotics and truly expericence it.

## What does getting Involved in Robotics do in terms of Career? 

Well, it does a number of things. First, it sets you on the path to join one of the fastest growing and most important industries in all of humanity. Robotics and Technology is essential to all of our future. Right now there is boom in technology jobs where so people are not even filling in all the gaps! Involving yourself in robotics is super important to be putting yourself into this evergrowing industry. Second, It improves how you will influence the world with your designs and ideas. With robotics, you can make any revolutionary and world-changing idea in your lifetime. You can even make multiple. One person, with just robotics, can have more influence on the world than 1,000 people. Robotics is a powerful tool that, if you start involving yourself with it early, it can have some amazing benefits. 

## My experience with Robotics

Well like most kids, My mom went to a store and gave me a toy. This toy was a RC car I had to build. I continuing to use these kits and I progressed in terms of my fascination. It went from Legos, RC Cars, Technics, and progressed further and further. It was this process of progression from Summer camp, to club, to doing for fun, and compeititon. It made me who I am today and what I want to do. Robotics has given me a whole new perspective of the world and I am a better person because of it. I have went from a kid who played with Ninajgo Legos to a bigger kid who doesn't just play. This kid, who builds and codes advanced robots and has dreams and aspirations of changing the world. I have changed this way due to Robotics and without it, I don't really know where I will be. I know that through Robotics, we all will acheive something great and truly impact the world.
