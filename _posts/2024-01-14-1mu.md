Today was decently productive. Andre fixed some positioning things about our new claw. Vikram Advaith and Dhanish worked on the portfolio. we implemented the new break system. Divit started to get everything ready to make pins for league meet. Vikram Divit and Andre along with Mentorship from Arsh added some additions to our claw. We also tried to get telemetry for our new claw code
