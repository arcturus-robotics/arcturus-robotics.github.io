Autonomous code for scoring two preloaded pixels kind of works. Hanging works better thanks to better code. Otherwise today was mainly just fine tuning of all the mechanisms also robot is i think completely competition ready. Also working on prototype for next version robot doesnt work well right now but who knows maybe someday. Oh and we also changed the position of outtake slide as well as drone launcher.
