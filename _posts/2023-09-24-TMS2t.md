We scored our first pixels on the backboard today! We mounted the new linear slide at about a 45 degree angle, and mounted a second servo to the inside pincer from before to tilt it, resulting in a working robot! We also made more progress on the drone launcher, and added MeepMeep testing code to the center-stage-app project. We also did tons of prototyping work for Vikram's intake idea using cardboard.
