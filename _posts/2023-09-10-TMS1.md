Today we started prototyping our mechanisms for the new season, Centerstage 2023-2024. Prototypes have been developed for both an inside pincer model for the pixels and a drone launcher. We also made CAD models for a different type of intake using wheels and another pincer. We updated V1's code to FTC SDK 9.0, making it competition legal. This was also done on the racecar (currently set to 0.5 motor max speed).
